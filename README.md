# Pokedex App By Declarative UI Pattern

## Overview

The Pokedex app allows users to browse and search for Pokémon, view detailed information about each Pokémon, and maintain a collection of favorite Pokémon. The app aims to provide a seamless user experience with a consistent design across all platforms.

## Purpose

This project is a Pokedex app implemented using the declarative UI pattern. The primary goal is to evaluate and compare the performance and development experience of the declarative UI pattern across three major platforms: Android, iOS, and Flutter. By implementing the same application with identical design and architecture on each platform, we aim to:

- Analyze Performance: Assess how well the declarative UI pattern performs on each platform in terms of responsiveness, load times, and overall efficiency.
- Evaluate Development Experience: Compare the ease of development, including code maintainability, readability, and the effectiveness of available tooling and frameworks for each platform.
- Ensure Consistency: Verify that the declarative UI pattern can provide a consistent user experience and visual design across different platforms.
- Identify Best Practices: Discover best practices and potential pitfalls specific to each platform when using the declarative UI approach.

Through this project, we aim to contribute to the knowledge base of mobile app development, providing practical insights and real-world data on the use of declarative UI patterns. This information will be beneficial for developers, designers, and anyone interested in modern mobile UI development.
